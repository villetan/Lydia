# Lydia
4 wheeled Arduino robot called Lydia. 
Main directory for Lydia is remotecarhome. This contains controls for my home TV remote controller where is implemented remote controlled Lydia controls as well as autopilot. The directory remotecarespoo is just different encodings for a different remote controller and autocar is a sketch which will only contain autocar.
