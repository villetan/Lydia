# Lydia
4 wheeled Arduino robot called Lydia. 
Main directory for Lydia is remotecarhome which contains remote controller encodings for her main remote controller. With the main sketch Lydia is a not so independent woman who can be controlled from the remote. Sometimes (when pressed the correct button) Lydia can also take over and start avoiding stuff on its own. The directory remotecarespoo is just different encodings for a different remote controller and autocar is a sketch which will only contain automated obstacle avoiuding code.
